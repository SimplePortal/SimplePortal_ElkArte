SimplePortal is always developing, and is produced with the user in mind first. User feedback is the number one method of growth for SimplePortal, and our users are always finding ways for Simpleportal to grow. SimplePortal stays competitive with other portal software by adding numerous user-requested features such as articles, block types and the ability to completely customize the portal page.

All this and SimplePortal has remained Simple! SimplePortal is built for simplicity and ease of use; ensuring the average forum administrator can install SimplePortal, configure a few settings, and show off the brand new portal to the users in minutes. Confusing menus, undesired pre-loaded blocks and settings that cannot be found are all avoided as much as possible. Because when it comes down to it, SimplePortal is YOUR portal, and should reflect your taste as much as possible.

## Features:
### Blocks
Blocks are small display areas you can add to the portal page or to forum pages. You can use blocks to add links for your users, or to show who is on line. With Simple Portal, the content part of any page can have LEFT and RIGHT blocks in left and right sidebars, and TOP and BOTTOM blocks between the sidebars above and below the central main content area.  There are also overall HEADER and FOOTER blocks that you can load with your content.

There are many built in blocks available so you can come up with a layout that suits your site.

Users can also drag and drop the blocks around to suit their particular tastes or screens, etc.

### Articles
With articles enabled, you will see articles on the Portal. You can also show a list of articles in an Articles block on the Portal or on a SimplePortal Page.

### Pages
The Simple Portal Custom page is something like the Simple Portal Portal Page. It has areas for blocks surrounding a central area.  The center area of a Simple Portal Custom Page is like a Simple Portal Block. The center area is similar to a custom BBC, HTML, or PHP block. 
When you create or edit a new Simple Portal Page, you will choose from BBC, HTML, or PHP. You will input your text, and save your page. You can discover the URL of the new page by looking at the pages list.
If you want links to your new page to appear somewhere that others can see, you will have to place these links yourself.  But don't worry -- this part is simple.
